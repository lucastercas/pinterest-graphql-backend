Initially, this project was supposed to be a copy of pinterest so I can learn
graphql with its backend (this repo) and react with the frontend, but I
ended up adding other features and now it don't even looks like pinterest, I 
guess.

The dotenv file:
1. NODE_ENV
2. MAIL_USER is the email used on the ethereal-mail
3. MAIL_PASSWORD is the password used on the ethereal-mail, like the username,
   it will be given to you when you create an email in [ethereal mail](https://ethereal.email/create)
4. SECRET is the secret used to create the JWT
5. APP_URL is the url of the front end
